- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### Usage

1. Run the main application:

```bash
    python main.py
```

2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the [notebooks](notebooks/) directory for data cleaning and model documentation.
